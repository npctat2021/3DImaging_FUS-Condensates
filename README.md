# 3DImaging_FUS-Condensates
MATLAB scripts to analyze properties of biomolecular condensates. This repository contains three separate folders dedicated to different single-molecule measurements made in this paper - Droplet density maps, 3D-astigmatism imaging and Single-molecule rotational diffusion microscopy (SiMRoD).  
Each folder contains instructions on what the scripts do, the data format needed to run them and the order in which they need to be run.
